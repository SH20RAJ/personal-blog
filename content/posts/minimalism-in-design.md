# The Art of Minimalism

Minimalism isn't just about removing things; it's about removing the *unnecessary* to let the meaningful stand out.

## Why it matters
In a world of noise, clarity is a superpower. Users appreciate interfaces that don't scream for attention but rather guide them gently.

### Key Principles
1. **Negative Space**: Give content room to breathe.
2. **Typography**: Use font weights and sizes to create hierarchy.
3. **Color**: Use color intentionally, not decoratively.
